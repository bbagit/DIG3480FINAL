Team Members:
Bryson Baggett

Modifications:
Strafe/Dodge Mechanic
Stamina Mechanic
End of Sprint Mechanic if out of Stamina

Biggest Challenge:
Definitely getting the Strafe mechanic to align with the stamina bar, and actually getting the strafe moment to not come out if the bar is empty.

I will continue working on this assignment for sure! I'd like to add a lot more post processing but was unable to get it to work. I'd also love to add some sort of puzzle aspect regarding a wall; you need to search around and press a button to make the wall move and open a path.
